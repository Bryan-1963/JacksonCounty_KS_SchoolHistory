	<b>City High Schools.</b><br>
	Most of the towns in Jackson County had high schools (one to four years) prior to the creation of the Rural High School system.  Students from the city school district could attend for free (paid for with local taxes) and students from surrounding districts could attend the high schools but had to pay tuition.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Rural High School Districts</b><br>
	During the mid to late 1910s new laws were put into place allowing the creation of Rural High School districts that would draw tax funds and students from several rural grade school districts.  This would eliminate the need for individual rural school districts to offer high school classes or pay tuition to other districts for their students to attend high school.<br>
