	<p><b>Welcome!</b>  This website is intended to serve as a reference source for information about public schools attended by students from Jackson County, Kansas.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The general outline of primary and secondary schools over time was:</p>

	<p style="padding-left:20px"><b>1) Territorial (before 1859) - </b>These were private schools and could have been religious or someone teaching in their home for tuition.  They were organized prior to Counties chartering public schools.</p>
	<p style="padding-left:20px"><b>2) County Districts (1859- ca1968) - </b>
	These were public schools, chartered by county governments.  "Joint" districts could and did extend across county boundaries.  
	Local school districts were set up, usually only a few square miles in size.  Local school boards were elected set property tax rates and administered the schools.  
	Schoolhouses were built in a central location to minimize the distance students needed to travel to school with a general rule of "no more than two miles walk for any student."
	Initially, all the schools offered a "common school" curriculum that could end with an 8th grade graduation diploma.  
	Some of the school districts, especially within towns, added more grade levels over time and students from adjoining districts could attend the higher levels by either personal or district payments of tuition.
	later in this period, as the student population became sparser and transportation improved, some school districts consolidated into larger districts and 
	others simply did not hire teachers but paid tuition to adjoining districts for their students to attend.

	<p style="padding-left:20px"><b>3) Pottawatomie Mission - </b>These were schools that were chartered and run by the Federal Government for tribal students.</p>
	<p style="padding-left:20px"><b>4) County High Schools - </b>These were public schools, chartered by counties.  They include Rural High Schools and City High Schools. 
	"Joint" districts could and did extend across county boundaries.  Some high schools, particularly in towns, were established prior to the laws creating Rural High Schools.  
	The Rural High School law allowed creation of districts encompassing multiple County Districts into a single tax entity for the high school, 
	while the individual County Districts continued operation for grades one through eight.</p>
	<p style="padding-left:20px"><b>5) Unified School Districts (ca1968-present) - </b>These are public schools, chartered by the State of Kansas.  
	School District boundaries are not restricted by county boundaries and this system continues to this day.</p>
	<p style="padding-left:20px"><b>6) Colleges - </b>In Jackson County, all of these were private schools.  Campbell College in Holton was the only successful college in the county.  A seminary was planned and built in Circleville but never came to fruition.</p>
