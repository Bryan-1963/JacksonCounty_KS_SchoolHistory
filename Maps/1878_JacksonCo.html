	<ol type="1">
		<li>Banner, Garfield and Lincoln Townships did not yet exist.</li>
		<li>The size and scale of this map only supports determining which quarter-section a school was located in.</li>
		<li>The schoolhouse locations are indicated but they are not numbered on the original map.  District numbers in this image are best guesses based on later locations.</li>
		<li>There are several schools indicated on this map that do not correspond to known schools and could have been private schools:</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Whiting Township: southeast of the intersection of what is now 199th Street (Brown County) and X Road.  There is also no known school nearby in Brown County.</li>
				<li>Northwestern Washington Township: halfway between what is now C and D Roads and about ¼ mile south of 190 Road (Ref 78) [39°23'12.5"N 95°59'15.2"W].  This was likely a private school since there were no schools in the immediate vicinity that were chartered prior to 1878.</li>
				<li>Pottawatomie Reservation: northwest corner of what is now the intersection of 142 Road and O Road.</li>
