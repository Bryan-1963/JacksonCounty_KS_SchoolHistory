	<p class="contentText">Permission for the first school district in Jackson County was granted. The first building was a log cabin that was a church and school prior to an organized district. 
	At the time the cabin was located on the Pottawatomi Reservation (before the reservation was diminished in 1861? 
	It appears that the reservation extended east to what is now Q4 Road prior to 1861 (Ref 63, F.64)? 
	Which would be 1 mile west of the later location of Brick schoolhouse…?) and it was about ½ mile from the later location of Brick School. 
	One log was left out of the wall to provide lighting. (Ref 45).</p>
